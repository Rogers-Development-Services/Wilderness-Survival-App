It is a common scenario faced by many survivalists.",notes:"Thankfully, it is easy to remedy this situation. Just add some charcoal while boiling the water. Charcoal is an excellent adsorbent that can get rid of many impurities including foul taste, smell and color. Always collect charcoal from your fire in a tight container.",icon:"local_dining"},{category:"Sustinance",title:"Collect Rain Water",description:"Rainwater is perhaps the purest form of water available in the wild. You can collect the rainwater and use it to drink with no need to filter. There are many simple ways to collect rainwater.",notes:"A lot of rainwater is collected on top of large leaves. If you can find a tree with huge leaves, you can often find some water pooled on some of them. Tall grass also has a lot of water droplets all over their blades. If you carefully cut the grass and ring them out, you can collect enough water to quench your thirst. You can also soak up the moisture on the grass with your clothes and ring them out to get some fresh, pure water.",icon:"local_dining"},{category:"Sustinance",title:"Coconuts Can Save Your Life",description:"Coconut water contains vital nutrients and sugar that can keep you fed and alive for long. If you can find coconut trees, make sure that you use the water as food.",notes:"However, remember that if you drink too much coconut water, it can give you the runs! In that case, just eat some powdered charcoal.

There is a real possibility that an animal may bite you! In such cases, it is important to know the best way to tackle this situation.",notes:"The first step is to tie a ligature around the limb, above the bite to restrict the blood from flowing from the wound into the other parts of your body. Once this is done, the next step is to wash the wound as thoroughly as possible. If you have soap, use soap water to clean the wound. Your job is to prevent any parasites in the animal bite from reaching the blood. Washing thoroughly can get rid of some pests reducing the parasite load. It gives your immune system a better chance to fight the infection. If you have alcohol handy, pour some alcohol on the wound. It will further decrease the number of pathogens. Although to be effective, you must use hard drinks such as whiskey or rum. Drinks like beer have too less alcohol to be of any help in this situation.",icon:"healing"},{category:"First-Aid",title:"Do Not Use Dirty Water to Clean Wounds",description:"If you are injured or have a flesh wound, make sure that you are not washing the wound with dirty water that is filled with microbes.",notes:"Water from many waterbodies may seem clear, but it is filled with microscopic organisms that may cause severe infections. If you must wash the wound, make sure that you use clean water. If you can boil water, then use boiled water to clean the wounds. If you can\u2019t use boiled water, you can use the water collected from tree transpiration. If you have alcohol with you, wash the wounds with high proof alcoholic spirits. Avoid beer and wine, these beverages contain a lot of sugar and not enough alcohol to help in any scenario.",icon:"healing"},{category:"First-Aid",title:"Take Care of the Blisters as Soon as Possible",description:"When you walk for a long distance, it is common to get blisters on your feet. If you don\u2019t take care of these blisters as soon as possible, they will prevent you from covering distance. If the blister has already been formed, just punctured to relieve the fluid buildup.",notes:"If you sense that a blister may be forming, use a small piece of duct tape to prevent it.",icon:"healing"},{category:"First-Aid",title:"Learn the Medicinal Properties of Wild Plants",description:"There are a ton of plant species in the wilderness. Many of these plants have excellent medicinal properties. Crab apples, for instance, have an astringent effect that can help heal wounds. Pine resin has excellent antiseptic properties. If you can find eucalyptus leaves, you can burn them to get rid of mosquitoes and other bugs around your campsite.",notes:"Acorns and oak bark have excellent medicinal properties to heal gastrointestinal problems. If you can find some acorns and oak bark, just boil it in water for 5 minutes and drink the concoction. It will help you fight diarrhea and other gastro-intestinal issues. If you are constipated, use rose hip leaves. You can make a decoction by boiling the green fleshy parts of the plant in water. Drink this before you go to bed for relieving constipation. If you are having insect bite problems, dock leaves can be of great help. Just pulverize them and apply directly on the bite. The anti-histamine properties of the leaves can assist in easing the itch and pain. Willow bark contains salicylic acid, which is the active form of aspirin. You can chew on the middle willow barks if you have a fever of a headache to good effect. However, always remember that you should not eat any plant unless you are sure you can identify them correctly.",icon:"healing"},{category:"First-Aid",title:"Add Aluminum Foil to Your Survival Kit",description:"Aluminum foil is a versatile tool that is a must carry in a survival kit.
